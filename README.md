# Projects undertaken

## Neural networks and deep learning

### Hand written digit recognition

These are projects undertaken in my own time in preparation for pursuing Computational Neuroscience, providing greater insight into AI and how we can start to model thought and learning using computation.<br>

Using the NIST handwritten digit dataset, a 3 layer neural network was trained to recognise digits with >95% accuracy. This was all written using numpy and standard python libraries, and so required learning the maths behind gradient decent and back propogation in order to implement them properly.<br>

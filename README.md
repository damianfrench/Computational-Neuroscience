# Projects undertaken

## Neural networks and deep learning

### Hand written digit recognition

These are projects undertaken in my own time in preparation for pursuing Computational Neuroscience, providing greater insight into AI and how we can start to model thought and learning using computation.<br>

Using the NIST handwritten digit dataset, a 3 layer neural network was trained to recognise digits with >95% accuracy.
